DO NOT CHANGE — CURRENT PHASE PLAN (Detailed Tasks)

Purpose:
- This plain-text companion to `current_phase_plan.docx` contains the active phase's
  granular tasks and checkboxes for automation-friendly status tracking. It is the
  single source of truth for task-level automation and model handoffs.

Format rules:
- Each task line begins with a checkbox: "[ ]" incomplete or "[x]" complete.
- Tasks may include one-line contexts or a short command in parentheses for reproducibility.
- Do not change existing task text except for the checkbox marker when marking progress.

Required fields per task (if applicable):
- Task Title: concise description.
- Owner: (optional) who is responsible.
- Command: (optional) exact shell or python command to run.
- Notes: (optional) short clarifying sentence.

Example:
[ ] Run unit tests (owner: QA)
    Command: pytest tests/test_module.py::test_function
    Notes: Fix failing assertion in `module.py` if present.

When adding new tasks, append them at the end of the file to preserve historical order.

DO NOT CHANGE this file's checkbox format or existing task wording; automation relies on
these exact tokens to parse and advance workflow.

---------------------------------------------CONTENTS STARTS HERE-----------------------------------------
[x] Stream A: Compute Box Score Profile Stats
    Command: python src/data_compute/compute_player_profiles.py
    Notes: Aggregates PBP events (PTS, AST, REB, TOV) correctly. Validated against B-Ref.

[x] Stream A: Compute Linear Metrics (WS, BPM)
    Command: python src/data_compute/compute_linear_metrics.py
    Notes: ✅ COMPLETE - All metrics passing validation:
           WS MAE: 0.29, OWS MAE: 0.65, DWS MAE: 0.71, BPM MAE: 0.89, VORP MAE: 0.55
           Implemented full B-REF BPM 2.0 with position/role adjustment.

[x] Stream A: Compute xRAPM (Regression Metric)
    Command: python src/data_compute/compute_xrapm.py
    Notes: ✅ COMPLETE - xRAPM with BPM Bayesian prior.
           Validation: MAE 1.14, Correlation 0.564 vs xRAPM.com benchmark.
           Bigs: MAE 0.92, Corr 0.91 (excellent). Wings: MAE 1.48, Corr 0.12 (needs work).
           Data: 100% coverage (1680 player-seasons), production grade.

[x] Stream B: Fetch Tracking & Style Data
    Command: python src/data_fetch/fetch_tracking_data.py
    Notes: ✅ COMPLETE - All tracking data fetched:
           11 Synergy Offensive playtypes, 7 Defensive playtypes
           9 Tracking metrics (Drives, Passing, Possessions, CatchShoot, etc.)
           3 Defense tracking files. All seasons 2022-25.

[ ] Stream C: Player Archetype Classification (Active)
    Command: python src/data_compute/compute_player_archetypes.py
    Notes: Classify players into 7 offensive archetypes based on playtype frequency,
           ball dominance, playmaking, and scoring profile.

[ ] Stream D: Archetype Evaluation & Model Integration
    Command: python src/modeling/evaluate_players.py
    Notes: Merge archetypes with xRAPM, validate classifications, prepare for prediction models.
