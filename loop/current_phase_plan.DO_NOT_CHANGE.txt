DO NOT CHANGE — CURRENT PHASE PLAN (Detailed Tasks)

Purpose:
- This plain-text companion to `current_phase_plan.docx` contains the active phase's
  granular tasks and checkboxes for automation-friendly status tracking. It is the
  single source of truth for task-level automation and model handoffs.

Format rules:
- Each task line begins with a checkbox: "[ ]" incomplete or "[x]" complete.
- Tasks may include one-line contexts or a short command in parentheses for reproducibility.
- Do not change existing task text except for the checkbox marker when marking progress.

Required fields per task (if applicable):
- Task Title: concise description.
- Owner: (optional) who is responsible.
- Command: (optional) exact shell or python command to run.
- Notes: (optional) short clarifying sentence.

Example:
[ ] Run unit tests (owner: QA)
    Command: pytest tests/test_module.py::test_function
    Notes: Fix failing assertion in `module.py` if present.

When adding new tasks, append them at the end of the file to preserve historical order.

DO NOT CHANGE this file's checkbox format or existing task wording; automation relies on
these exact tokens to parse and advance workflow.

---------------------------------------------CONTENTS STARTS HERE-----------------------------------------
[x] Stream A: Compute Box Score Profile Stats
    Command: python src/data_compute/compute_player_profiles.py
    Notes: Aggregates PBP events (PTS, AST, REB, TOV) correctly. Validated against B-Ref.

[x] Stream A: Compute Linear Metrics (WS, BPM)
    Command: python src/data_compute/compute_linear_metrics.py
    Notes: ✅ COMPLETE - All metrics passing validation:
           WS MAE: 0.29, OWS MAE: 0.65, DWS MAE: 0.71, BPM MAE: 0.89, VORP MAE: 0.55
           Implemented full B-REF BPM 2.0 with position/role adjustment.

[ ] Stream A: Compute RAPM (Regression Metric)
    Command: python src/data_compute/compute_rapm.py
    Notes: Requires completed/validated Linear Metrics to serve as Bayesian Priors.

[ ] Stream B: Fetch Tracking & Style Data
    Command: python src/data_fetch/fetch_tracking_data.py
    Notes: Fetch Drives, Catch & Shoot, and Iso data from `leaguedashptstats` endpoint.

[ ] Stream C: Archetype Classification & Evaluation
    Command: src/modeling/evaluate_players.py
    Notes: Merge Metrics + Tracking to classify players (e.g., "Ball Dominant Creator") and regress vs RAPM.

[x] Stream A: BPM tuning, documentation, and validation
    Command: python tests/validate_advanced_metrics.py && python src/data_compute/compute_linear_metrics.py
    Notes: Implemented team_net_rtg split (TEAM_NET_SCALE=0.25, IND_NET_SCALE=0.06), increased VERY_LOW_MIN_PENALTY to 3.0, added AST-based big bonus; updated `reference/BPM_trends.txt` with discoveries and validation summary (BPM MAE 0.67). Validation PASS.
