DO NOT CHANGE — OVERALL PLAN (Phase Boxes)

Purpose:
- This file mirrors the overall project plan stored in `overall_plan.docx` but in plain text
  for automated agents and reviewers. It lists major phases as checkable boxes; do not edit
  the phase descriptions or the checkbox markers unless you are intentionally updating the
  project's official plan and have coordinated with the team.

Format rules:
- Each major phase is a single line beginning with a checkbox marker: "[ ]" for incomplete,
  "[x]" for complete.
- Keep the phase title concise and the optional short description on the following indented line.
- When marking a phase as complete, do NOT modify the historical description; only change
  the checkbox marker.

Example:
[ ] Phase 1: Data Ingestion
    - Collect raw sources, standardize formats, store in `data/`.
[x] Phase 2: Data Processing
    - Normalize, validate, and compute derived features.

DO NOT CHANGE this file structure or the checkbox markers; downstream scripts and models
expect this exact format to parse progress programmatically.

If you need to add detail, append a separate bullet under the phase but preserve the
original phase title and checkbox marker.

End of file — DO NOT CHANGE
