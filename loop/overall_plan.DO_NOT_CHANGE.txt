DO NOT CHANGE — OVERALL PLAN (Phase Boxes)

Purpose:
- This file mirrors the overall project plan stored in `overall_plan.docx` but in plain text
  for automated agents and reviewers. It lists major phases as checkable boxes; do not edit
  the phase descriptions or the checkbox markers unless you are intentionally updating the
  project's official plan and have coordinated with the team.

Format rules:
- Each major phase is a single line beginning with a checkbox marker: "[ ]" for incomplete,
  "[x]" for complete.
- Keep the phase title concise and the optional short description on the following indented line.
- When marking a phase as complete, do NOT modify the historical description; only change
  the checkbox marker.

Example:
[ ] Phase 1: Data Ingestion
    - Collect raw sources, standardize formats, store in `data/`.
[x] Phase 2: Data Processing
    - Normalize, validate, and compute derived features.

DO NOT CHANGE this file structure or the checkbox markers; downstream scripts and models
expect this exact format to parse progress programmatically.

If you need to add detail, append a separate bullet under the phase but preserve the
original phase title and checkbox marker.

---------------------------------------------CONTENTS STARTS HERE-----------------------------------------
[x] Phase 1: Environment & Tooling Setup
    - Set up Git, virtual env, dependencies (pandas, nba_api, xgboost, streamlit).

[x] Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Storage
    - Fetch historical PBP, Team Logs, and Player stats; clean and store in Parquet/SQLite.

[x] Phase 3a: Advanced Metrics & xRAPM (Complete)
    - Computed WS, BPM, VORP (validated MAE < 1.0). Implemented xRAPM with BPM prior (MAE 1.14 vs benchmark).
    - Fixed data fetching: 100% player coverage (1680 player-seasons). Data is PRODUCTION GRADE.

[ ] Phase 3b: Player Archetype Classification (Active)
    - Build offensive/defensive player archetypes from tracking + synergy playtype data.
    - Archetypes: Ball Dominant Creator, Interior/Perimeter/All-Around Scorer, Ballhandler,
      Off-Ball Finisher, Off-Ball Movement Shooter, Off-Ball Stationary Shooter, Rotation Piece.

[ ] Phase 4: Model Development
    - Build Game Outcome (Logistic/XGBoost) and Player Performance (Regression/RF) models.

[ ] Phase 5: Evaluation & Interpretability
    - Cross-validation, SHAP analysis, and performance logging.

[ ] Phase 6: Web App Development (Streamlit)
    - Build Dashboards, Game Predictor UI, and Player Forecaster UI.

[ ] Phase 7: Automation & Deployment
    - Setup weekly auto-fetch scripts (cron/GitHub Actions) and deploy to cloud.
