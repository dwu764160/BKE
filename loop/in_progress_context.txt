DO NOT CHANGE — IN-PROGRESS CONTEXT (Machine-Readable Guidance)

Purpose:
- This file captures the full working context when a model or session encounters difficulty.
- It is intended to be written to by models that are failing on a task so other models can pick up
  where they left off. Do not manually edit this file unless you are coordinating the handoff.

Required Sections (use these headings exactly; other tools rely on them):
1) CONTEXT:
	- Brief summary of the task, current working directory, and any key files or inputs in use.
2) FAILURE_REASON:
	- Short, precise description of why the current attempt failed (errors, unexpected outputs).
3) ATTEMPTED_METHODS:
	- List the strategies, commands, and code changes that were tried (bullet list).
4) SOURCES_READ:
	- Links, files, docs, and commands consulted during troubleshooting.
5) NEXT_STEPS (explicit):
	- One-line actionable items the next agent should attempt, ordered by priority.

Formatting rules for automations:
- Keep each section label (e.g., CONTEXT:) on its own line, followed by content lines.
- Use plain text only — avoid embedding binary, images, or complex markup.
- Keep entries concise; prefer short bullet lists and single-line commands for reproducibility.

Example (template):
CONTEXT:
- Task: run `src/data_compute/audit_win_shares.py`
- Env: Linux, venv at `.venv/`, Python 3.10
- Key files: data/processed/player_profiles_advanced.parquet

FAILURE_REASON:
- ValueError: ambiguous DataFrame truth value raised at script exit check.

ATTEMPTED_METHODS:
- Added explicit None/empty check in `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
- Re-ran script under venv; verified output.

SOURCES_READ:
- Local repo files: src/data_compute/audit_win_shares.py

NEXT_STEPS:
- If error recurs, inspect `load_data()` return value and file path accessibility.

DO NOT CHANGE this file format or the section headings; other automated agents rely on them.
