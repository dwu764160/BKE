A Player/Team should be evaluated in my model based on different "categories". The higher score on a particular category means the better a player is. The culmination of these categories should tell us how a player is going to perform (aka predict his stats). Combine the categories with four factors, allows us to evaluate the player's performance/contribution as a whole.

Player Advanced Statistics:

--stats on basketball reference:

Usage Rate - Used to see how big a role the player has in offense

Effective Field Goal Percentage & True Shooting - how efficient a player is in terms of scoring

Turnover Percentage (TOV%)

Offensive Rebound Rate

Free Throw Attempt Rate

Total Rebound Rate

Assist Percentage

Steal Percentage

Block Percentage

Offensive Win Share

Defensive Win Share (can be calculated by total Win Share - Offensive Win Share, as with most defensive advanced statistics)

Total Win Share

Win Share per 48

Offensive Box Plus Minus

Defensive Box Plus Minus

Value Over Replacement

percentage of field goals assisted (by other players, two's and three's)

On-Off (plus-minus net per 100 possessions, this has both offense and defense stats. Is calculated by the difference between the TEAM'S offensive/defensive rating with that player on the court versus without that player on the court)

--Defensive Stats for the player

matchup versatility

matchup difficulty (both are a score out of 100)

Contests

Rim protection attempts

opponent field goal percentage difference as a defender

defensive rebound rate

defensive LEBRON

--Offensive categories for the player:

*include all relevant stats from basketball reference sections

Four factors with weight (also can apply to team)
	shooting (40%)
	turnovers (25%)
	Rebounding (20%)
	Free Throws (15%)

Three pointer impact (spacing is very important in today's NBA)
	production
	efficiency
	wide open three production/efficiency
	catch and shoot three production/efficiency


driving impact
	driving attempts
	driving efficiency
	free throw rate
	free throw percentage

transition impact

playmaking impact
	time of possession
	average dribbles

Screening impact (less important)

other scoring methods (this will relate to playtype)
	midrange
	floaters
	post/paint touches (shots)
-- Play type (another very important aspect to evaluate a player offensively):

we need to look the tendency of a player (the frequency/percentage of each playtype), their efficiency will be in terms of PPP (points per possession with the particular playtype). Given these two metrics, in conjunction with their production, will allow us to evaluate what the player is good at/ bad at offensively, and will help us make predictions

--Overall Advanced Statistics (these are overall impact indicators mostly, some are already mentioned in the basketball reference section)

EPM (best, probably behind a paid wall)

RAPM (only good for multiple seasons)

RAPTOR

DARKO

LEBRON

GmSC (good for smaller sample sizes)

real plus minus
	
box plus minus

VORP and On-Off (will be skewed based on their team personnel, for example, a player might have really high value over his replacement if his substitute is really bad)

Team advanced metrics:

Offensive/Defensive Rating

Net Rating

Assist Percentage

Assist Ratio

AST/TO

EFG%

oREB%

dREB%

PACE - very important context

TO%

----------------------Conclusion:

As you can see, while advanced statistics is important, they also require context. A player with a large share of the possession usually has way higher responsibility to create offense, and therefore it is important to consider their respective production, as well as playtype distribution (i.e. an off-dribble shot, or a three is inherently harder than a cutting dunk), when we are evaluating a player's skill. A player can also be really skilled/efficient but has less opportunities/usage given that their teammates are more ball dominant. These are all things we need to consider when it comes to evaluation. With the context of usage in mind, we can evaluate players on a per 36/48 minute basis (as is standard in the NBA), this evaluates what could happen IF (big if) they can scale up their usage rate. similarly, we can also use per 100 possession stats for teams/players (more so teams than players). they come with less context, especially for teams.


Player Archetypes: (note: some stats, such as driving, screening/screening assists and secondary assists, are not part of playtype stats but will be used for context)

Ball Dominant Creator - Really high ISO, PnRBH, or Post Up frequencies AND decently high playmaking scores (assists, passes, secondary assists, possession)

Interior/Perimeter/All-Around Scorer - Low playmaking scores AND high ISO, PnRBH, Post Up, Off Screen, or Handoff frequency. High driving and low 3pt frequencies = interior, and vice versa or all - around

Ballhandler - High playmaking scores and ball dominant, not very high scoring volume

Off-Ball Finisher - High Cut, PnRRm, or Putback. Also Consider Transition (a little bit)

Off-Ball Movement Shooter - High Handoff and Offscreen

Off-Ball Stationary Shooter - High Spot Up, Less High Handoff and Offscreen (Both have high three point frequency)

Rotation Pieces/Glue Guy - All around, not a high usage rate


As you can see, some archetypes doesn't involve playtype frequency, first look at how ball dominant they are + their scoring output, then decide based on frequency
