BPM (BOX PLUS/MINUS) FORMULA DOCUMENTATION & TRENDS
================================================================================
Last Updated: January 2026
Validation Set: 88 player-seasons across 31 players (Batch 4 added)
Current BPM MAE: 0.79 (Previous: 0.63, Change: +25% from expanded validation set)
Mean Bias: +0.103 (Previous: +0.562)

NOTE: MAE increased due to intentionally adding high-error players (Batch 4)
to stress-test root cause hypotheses. The formula itself is unchanged.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: BPM FORMULA OVERVIEW
================================================================================

BPM 2.0 is a box-score estimate of player contribution per 100 possessions.
0.0 = league average, +10 = superstar, -5 = below replacement

Formula Flow:
1. Calculate percentage stats (%TRB, %STL, %AST, %BLK, %PF)
2. Derive Position (1-5) from percentage stats via regression
3. **APPLY TEAM POSITION ADJUSTMENT (NEW)** - Force team avg = 3.0
4. Derive Offensive Role (1-5) from AST% and efficiency
5. Calculate per-100 stats (PTS, AST, TRB, STL, BLK, TOV, FGA, FTA, PF)
6. Apply position-adjusted coefficients to per-100 stats
7. Add position constant and role constant
8. Add regression intercept and center at league level
9. Apply custom adjustments (AST bonus, NET_RTG, minutes regression)
10. Compress and offset final result

================================================================================
SECTION 2: INPUT STATS & COEFFICIENTS
================================================================================

STEP 1: PERCENTAGE CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------
%TRB = (TRB/MIN) / (LEAGUE_TRB/LEAGUE_MIN) * 0.20   [Clamp: 0.05-0.40]
%STL = (STL/MIN) / (LEAGUE_STL/LEAGUE_MIN) * 0.20   [Clamp: 0.02-0.35]
%AST = (AST/MIN) / (LEAGUE_AST/LEAGUE_MIN) * 0.20   [Clamp: 0.02-0.50]
%BLK = (BLK/MIN) / (LEAGUE_BLK/LEAGUE_MIN) * 0.20   [Clamp: 0.00-0.50]
%PF  = (PF/MIN)  / (LEAGUE_PF/LEAGUE_MIN)  * 0.20   [Clamp: 0.05-0.30]

STEP 2: POSITION REGRESSION
---------------------------
Position = 2.130 + 8.668*%TRB - 2.486*%STL + 0.992*%PF - 3.536*%AST + 1.667*%BLK
[Clamp: 1.0 (PG) to 5.0 (C)]

STEP 2b: TEAM POSITION ADJUSTMENT (NEW - January 2026)
------------------------------------------------------
From B-REF: "Next, the team sum is calculated to make sure that the 
minutes-weighted team average is 3.0"

Implementation:
1. For each team-season, calculate minutes-weighted average position
2. Compute offset = 3.0 - team_avg_position  
3. Add offset to each player's position on that team
4. Re-clamp to [1.0, 5.0]

Results:
- Applied to 90 team-seasons
- Average adjustment magnitude: 0.133 positions
- BPM MAE improved from 1.219 to 1.157 (5.1%)
- Mean bias reduced from +0.562 to +0.103

Why this matters:
- Jokić's position was being calculated as ~3.4-3.8 due to high AST
- After team adjustment, his position correctly increases toward C
- Similarly fixes other playmaking bigs (Sabonis, Sengun)

STEP 3: OFFENSIVE ROLE REGRESSION
---------------------------------
Role = 6.00 - 6.642*%AST - 8.544*ThresholdPts
ThresholdPts = %PTS * (1 + (TS% - 0.54) * 2)
[Clamp: 1.0 to 5.0]

STEP 4: PER-100 STATS
---------------------
All box score stats converted to per-100 possessions:
- pts_per100, fga_per100, fta_per100, fg3m_per100
- ast_per100, tov_per100, orb_per100, drb_per100
- stl_per100, blk_per100, pf_per100

STEP 5: POSITION-ADJUSTED COEFFICIENTS
--------------------------------------
Variable          | Coef @ Pos 1 (PG) | Coef @ Pos 5 (C) | Notes
------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------
PTS (adjusted)    | 0.860             | 0.860            | Fixed across positions
3PM               | 0.389             | 0.389            | Fixed across positions
AST               | 0.580             | 1.034            | Bigs get more credit
TOV               | -0.964            | -0.964           | Fixed (always bad)
ORB               | 0.613             | 0.181            | Guards get more credit
DRB               | 0.116             | 0.181            | Slight variation
STL               | 1.369             | 1.008            | Guards get more credit
BLK               | 1.327             | 0.703            | Guards get more credit
PF                | -0.367            | -0.367           | Fixed (always bad)

Role-Adjusted Coefficients:
Variable | Coef @ Role 1 | Coef @ Role 5 | Notes
---------|---------------|---------------|------------------
FGA      | -0.560        | -0.780        | Receivers penalized more
FTA      | -0.246        | -0.343        | Receivers penalized more

Linear interpolation: coef = coef_1 + (coef_5 - coef_1) * (pos - 1) / 4

STEP 6: CONSTANTS
-----------------
Position Constant: 
  - 0 for Position >= 3.0
  - Linear from 0 to -0.818 as Position goes from 3.0 to 1.0
  - Guards are penalized because box score overvalues them

Role Constant:
  - Linear from -2.774 (creator, role=1) to +2.774 (receiver, role=5)
  - Adjusts for low-usage players being undervalued by box score

STEP 7: CENTERING
-----------------
1. Add REGRESSION_INTERCEPT = -8.0
2. Center each season to mean = 0 (weighted by possessions)

================================================================================
SECTION 3: CUSTOM ADJUSTMENTS (OUR IMPLEMENTATION)
================================================================================

A) AST-BASED BIG BONUS
----------------------
Triggers when: Position > 3.0 AND AST/MIN > 0.20
Formula: 14.0 * (Position - 3.0) * (AST/MIN - 0.10)
Purpose: Jokić-style playmaking bigs are undervalued by standard formula

B) NET_RTG ADJUSTMENT
---------------------
Formula: 0.11 * NET_RTG (player's on-court plus/minus)
Purpose: Incorporates team context - players on good teams are slightly boosted

C) COMPRESSION & OFFSET
-----------------------
Final BPM = (adjusted_bpm * 0.89) + 0.60
Purpose: Scale results to match B-REF distribution

D) MINUTES REGRESSION (STEP 7b)
-------------------------------
Threshold: 2000 minutes
Strength: 1.0 BPM
Formula: BPM = BPM - 1.0 * max(0, 1 - MIN/2000)
Purpose: Low-minute players regress toward replacement level

================================================================================
SECTION 4: VORP CALCULATION
================================================================================

VORP = (BPM - (-2.0)) * (MIN / (GP * 48)) * (GP / 82)

Where:
- -2.0 = replacement level BPM
- MIN / (GP * 48) = percentage of team minutes played
- GP / 82 = games adjustment

ERROR BY POSITION CATEGORY
--------------------------
Position      | Count | Mean Error | MAE  | Std Dev | Trend
--------------|-------|------------|------|---------|---------------------------
PG (1-2)      |  12   |   +0.18    | 1.45 |  1.89   | ⚠️ High variance (Trae, Hali)
SG/SF (2-3)   |  16   |   +0.42    | 1.12 |  1.32   | Slight overestimate
SF/PF (3-4)   |  18   |   +0.45    | 1.15 |  1.58   | Luka/Sabonis outliers
PF/C (4-5)    |  18   |   -0.35    | 0.83 |  0.88   | ✅ Best category

SYSTEMIC ISSUE: PG category has highest variance due to Trae Young underestimate
and Tyrese Haliburton overestimate. SF/PF has Luka/Sabonis driving errors up.

================================================================================
SECTION 6: WORST INDIVIDUAL ERRORS - ANALYSIS
================================================================================

OUTLIER 1: LUKA DONČIĆ (+3.5 avg error across seasons)
------------------------------------------------------
- Our BPM: +10.1 to +10.2 in earlier seasons, +7.2 in 2024-25
- B-REF BPM: +6.2 to +7.0
- Position: 2.35-2.68 (calculated as SG/SF)
- Root cause: Box score loves his stats (scoring, assists, rebounds)
- Reality: Defense is weak, turnover-heavy, pace-dependent
- Possible fix: Defensive efficiency penalty, turnover weighting

OUTLIER 2: DOMANTAS SABONIS (+3.0 avg error in older seasons)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Our BPM: +6.7 to +7.6 vs B-REF +3.7 to +4.6
- Position: 4.11-4.65
- Root cause: Triple-double machine but low-value rebounds
- Reality: Uncontested rebounds don't create value like contested
- Possible fix: Distinguish contested vs uncontested rebounds

OUTLIER 3: TRAE YOUNG (-2.4 avg error across seasons)
-----------------------------------------------------
- Our BPM: +1.5 to +3.4 vs B-REF +3.9 to +5.8
- Position: 1.0 (floor - pure PG)
- Root cause: We may be over-penalizing small guards
- Reality: His playmaking creates more value than box score shows
- Possible fix: Increase AST coefficient for point guards

OUTLIER 4: TYRESE HALIBURTON 2024-25 (+4.36 error)
-------------------------------------------------
- Our BPM: +6.0 vs B-REF +1.6
- Context: Injured season - may have played when not fully healthy
- Root cause: Small sample + efficiency drop not captured
- Possible fix: This may self-correct with injury context

================================================================================
SECTION 7: PLAYER-LEVEL SYSTEMATIC BIAS
================================================================================

MOST UNDERRATED (We compute LOWER than B-REF)
---------------------------------------------
Player               | Pos | Mean Err | Analysis
---------------------|-----|----------|---------------------------
Trae Young           | 1.0 |  -2.40   | Pure PG, playmaking undervalued
Devin Booker         | 1.8 |  -0.60   | SG/PG, scoring efficiency issues
Stephen Curry        | 2.2 |  -1.23   | Elite PG, gravity not captured
Paul George          | 2.4 |  -1.02   | Two-way wing, defense uncredited
Kevin Durant         | 3.1 |  -0.53   | Scoring wing, slight under
LeBron James         | 2.6 |  -0.97   | All-around, slight under

MOST OVERRATED (We compute HIGHER than B-REF)
---------------------------------------------
Player               | Pos | Mean Err | Analysis
---------------------|-----|----------|---------------------------
Luka Dončić          | 2.5 |  +2.76   | Defense/TOV not penalized enough
Domantas Sabonis     | 4.3 |  +1.72   | Uncontested rebounds overvalued
Tyrese Haliburton    | 1.2 |  +2.32   | Injury season anomaly
Jordan Clarkson      | 2.0 |  +1.38   | Low-efficiency volume scorer
SGA                  | 2.2 |  +1.41   | Defensive metrics may be off
Corey Kispert        | 2.7 |  +1.37   | Off-ball role overvalued

================================================================================
SECTION 8: IDENTIFIED SYSTEMIC ISSUES (Detailed Root Cause Analysis)
================================================================================

CAUSE 1: LOW MINUTE INFLATION (Overrated, +1.5 to +2.1 error)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Players with < 1000 MIN get inflated BPM despite minutes regression

Player               | Season   | Error | MIN  | TS%   | Analysis
---------------------|----------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------
Mark Williams        | 2022-23  | +1.5  | 826  | 65.9% | Young center, small sample
Dominick Barlow      | 2022-23  | +2.1  | 400  | 56.7% | Very low minutes
Jordan Clarkson      | 2024-25  | +1.5  | 963  | 54.1% | Edge case

FIX: Increase MIN_REGRESSION_STRENGTH from 1.0 to 1.5 for MIN < 1000


CAUSE 2: LOW EFFICIENCY VOLUME SCORERS (Overrated, +1.4 to +1.9 error)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Below-average TS% players with high FGA get too much credit for volume

Player               | Season   | Error | MIN  | TS%   | Analysis
---------------------|----------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------
Jordan Clarkson      | 2023-24  | +1.9  | 1674 | 52.1% | Below-avg TS%, high volume
Jonathan Kuminga     | 2024-25  | +1.4  | 1138 | 53.5% | Below-avg TS%, high usage

Key insight: Jordan Clarkson 2023-24 has TS% = 52.1% vs league avg 55%
He scores -1.5 pts/100 vs expectation, but we don't penalize this enough

FIX: Add efficiency penalty: If TS% < 54%, apply penalty of:
     (54% - TS%) * SCORING_VOLUME * EFFICIENCY_PENALTY_SCALE


CAUSE 3: OFF-BALL WING OVERRATE (Overrated, +1.2 to +2.1 error)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Efficient but non-playmaking wings get the Role Constant bonus they don't deserve

Player               | Season   | Error | MIN  | TS%   | %AST  | Analysis
---------------------|----------|-------|------|-------|-------|------------------
Corey Kispert        | 2023-24  | +2.1  | 2060 | 62.1% | 0.137 | Efficient catch-shoot
Corey Kispert        | 2024-25  | +1.7  | 1597 | 58.4% | 0.117 | Low playmaking
Brandin Podziemski   | 2024-25  | +1.2  | 1712 | 55.7% | 0.233 | Rookie, off-ball
Moussa Diabaté       | 2024-25  | +1.7  | 1234 | 60.9% | 0.082 | Rim runner

Problem: Role constant boosts "receivers" (Role 3-5) by up to +2.774
But off-ball players getting easy shots shouldn't get full bonus

FIX: Modify Role Constant to reduce bonus for low-AST%, low-PTS% receivers


CAUSE 4: ELITE PLAYMAKER UNDERRATE (Underrated, -1.1 to -2.0 error)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Elite playmakers with high AST% AND high TS% are underrated

Player               | Season   | Error | MIN  | TS%   | %AST  | Analysis
---------------------|----------|-------|------|-------|-------|------------------
Stephen Curry        | 2023-24  | -2.0  | 2429 | 61.6% | 0.282 | Elite playmaker
Stephen Curry        | 2024-25  | -2.0  | 2260 | 61.8% | 0.338 | Elite playmaker
Nikola Jokić         | 2024-25  | -1.1  | 2562 | 66.3% | 0.507 | Elite big playmaker
Julius Randle        | 2023-24  | -1.2  | 1627 | 56.9% | 0.254 | High usage PF

Problem: We have AST bonus for bigs (Position > 3), but not for guards
Stephen Curry creates massive value through playmaking + gravity

FIX: Add ELITE_PLAYMAKER_BONUS for guards (Position < 3) with:
     AST% > 0.28 AND TS% > 58%


CAUSE 5: EFFICIENT ROLE PLAYER UNDERRATE (Underrated, -1.0 to -1.2 error)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
High-efficiency role players don't get enough credit for their efficiency

Player               | Season   | Error | MIN  | TS%   | %AST  | Analysis
---------------------|----------|-------|------|-------|-------|------------------
Julius Randle        | 2022-23  | -1.0  | 2730 | 58.2% | 0.221 | High volume, decent eff
Daniel Gafford       | 2024-25  | -1.2  | 1224 | 71.6% | 0.119 | Elite rim efficiency
Aaron Gordon         | 2024-25  | -1.2  | 1442 | 65.0% | 0.206 | Efficient two-way

Problem: Daniel Gafford has 71.6% TS% (elite!) but doesn't score enough
to benefit from our efficiency adjustments

FIX: Add bonus for TS% > 60% regardless of volume

================================================================================
SECTION 9: RECOMMENDED NEXT FIXES (Priority Order)
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1: EFFICIENCY PENALTY FOR LOW TS% VOLUME SCORERS
---------------------------------------------------------
Impact: Would fix Jordan Clarkson (+1.9), Jonathan Kuminga (+1.4)
Implementation:
  - Calculate TS_below_avg = max(0, 0.54 - TS_PCT)
  - scoring_volume = PTS / POSS * 100  (per-100)
  - penalty = TS_below_avg * scoring_volume * 0.15
  - Apply: BPM = BPM - penalty
Expected improvement: ~0.03 MAE reduction

PRIORITY 2: ELITE PLAYMAKER BONUS FOR GUARDS
--------------------------------------------
Impact: Would fix Stephen Curry (-2.0), Julius Randle (-1.2)
Implementation:
  - Trigger: Position < 3.0 AND AST% > 0.28 AND TS% > 0.58
  - Bonus = (AST% - 0.20) * (TS% - 0.54) * 15.0
  - Apply: BPM = BPM + bonus
Expected improvement: ~0.05 MAE reduction

PRIORITY 3: OFF-BALL WING ADJUSTMENT  
------------------------------------
Impact: Would fix Corey Kispert (+2.1), Moussa Diabaté (+1.7)
Implementation:
  - For players with AST% < 0.15 AND Role > 2.5:
  - Reduce role constant bonus by 50%
Expected improvement: ~0.02 MAE reduction

PRIORITY 4: STRONGER LOW-MINUTE REGRESSION
------------------------------------------
Impact: Would fix Mark Williams (+1.5), Dominick Barlow (+2.1)
Implementation:
  - For MIN < 1000: increase regression strength to 1.5
  - For MIN < 500: increase regression strength to 2.0
Expected improvement: ~0.01 MAE reduction

PRIORITY 5: HIGH EFFICIENCY BONUS
---------------------------------
Impact: Would fix Daniel Gafford (-1.2), Aaron Gordon (-1.2)
Implementation:
  - For TS% > 0.60: Add bonus = (TS% - 0.58) * 8.0
  - Cap at +1.0 BPM
Expected improvement: ~0.01 MAE reduction

================================================================================
SECTION 10: CHANGE LOG
================================================================================

January 2026 - Team Position Adjustment
---------------------------------------
- Added B-REF's team-level position adjustment
- Forces each team's minutes-weighted position average = 3.0
- Impact: BPM MAE improved from 1.219 to 1.157 (5.1%)
- Mean bias reduced from +0.562 to +0.103
- Biggest beneficiary: Jokić (error -0.04 vs previous +0.53)

January 2026 - Batch 4 Root Cause Validation
---------------------------------------------
Added 8 players to stress-test 5 identified root cause categories:

CATEGORY 1: LOW-MINUTE (Gary Payton II, Luka Garza)
  Gary Payton II 2022-23: Error = -3.5 (calc: -2.0, ref: +1.5)
  Gary Payton II 2023-24: Error = -2.8 (calc: -0.6, ref: +2.2)
  Gary Payton II 2024-25: Error = +0.8 (calc: +0.8, ref: 0.0)
  Luka Garza 2023-24:     Error = +3.7 (calc: +1.0, ref: -2.7)
  Luka Garza 2024-25:     Error = +1.9 (calc: -0.4, ref: -2.3)
  FINDING: Mixed results - GP2 underrated despite low minutes, 
           Garza overrated. May be position/role dependent, not just minutes.

CATEGORY 2: LOW EFFICIENCY VOLUME (Jaden Ivey)
  Jaden Ivey 2022-23: Error = +1.6 (calc: -1.7, ref: -3.3)
  Jaden Ivey 2023-24: Error = +1.6 (calc: -1.5, ref: -3.1)
  Jaden Ivey 2024-25: Error = -0.2 (calc: -0.2, ref: 0.0)
  FINDING: CONFIRMED - Low efficiency scorers consistently overrated
           by ~1.6 BPM in high-minute seasons. 2024-25 improved BPM
           at B-REF may indicate growth.

CATEGORY 3: OFF-BALL WING (Moses Moody, AJ Green)
  Moses Moody 2022-23: Error = +0.5 (calc: -2.1, ref: -2.6)
  Moses Moody 2023-24: Error = -0.4 (calc: -0.3, ref: +0.1)
  Moses Moody 2024-25: Error = -0.2 (calc: -0.2, ref: 0.0)
  AJ Green 2022-23:    Error = +0.2 (calc: -0.7, ref: -0.9)
  AJ Green 2023-24:    Error = +0.5 (calc: -1.5, ref: -2.0)
  AJ Green 2024-25:    Error = +0.0 (calc: -2.0, ref: -2.0)
  FINDING: NOT CONFIRMED - Off-ball wings have low error (avg 0.2)

CATEGORY 4: ELITE PLAYMAKER (Luka Dončić)
  Luka Dončić 2022-23: Error = +1.9 (calc: 10.2, ref: 8.3)
  Luka Dončić 2023-24: Error = +0.2 (calc: 10.1, ref: 9.9)
  Luka Dončić 2024-25: Error = +0.5 (calc: 7.2, ref: 6.7)
  FINDING: PARTIAL - Luka overrated (not underrated like Curry)
           Issue may be defensive metrics, not playmaking undervalue

CATEGORY 5: EFFICIENT DUNKER (Jarrett Allen, Jericho Sims)
  Jarrett Allen 2022-23: Error = -0.9 (calc: 1.5, ref: 2.4)
  Jarrett Allen 2023-24: Error = -0.1 (calc: 2.9, ref: 3.0)
  Jarrett Allen 2024-25: Error = -2.1 (calc: 2.1, ref: 4.2)
  Jericho Sims 2022-23:  Error = -1.3 (calc: -1.8, ref: -0.5)
  Jericho Sims 2024-25:  Error = -1.2 (calc: -4.2, ref: -3.0)
  FINDING: CONFIRMED - Efficient dunkers underrated by 1-2 BPM
           TS% > 65% not getting enough credit in our formula

BATCH 4 SUMMARY:
  ✅ CONFIRMED: Low efficiency volume scoring (Ivey)
  ✅ CONFIRMED: Efficient dunker undervalue (Allen, Sims)
  ❌ NOT CONFIRMED: Off-ball wing overrate (Moody, Green errors low)
  ⚠️ PARTIAL: Low minute inflation (mixed results, position-dependent)
  ⚠️ PARTIAL: Elite playmaker (Luka overrated, not underrated)

================================================================================
SECTION 11: DETAILED ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - UNCONFIRMED CATEGORIES
================================================================================
Updated after efficiency adjustments (Step 7c) and deep investigation.

UNCONFIRMED CATEGORY 1: LOW-MINUTE PLAYERS
------------------------------------------
FINDING: NOT a uniform pattern. The issue is DEFENSIVE VALUE not being captured.

Gary Payton II (UNDERRATED by 2.7-3.5 BPM):
  - Elite TS%: 70%, 62%, 63% - gets HIGH_EFF_BONUS correctly
  - Elite steals: 2.1/36 - defensive specialist
  - NET_RTG: +3.2, +10.0, +1.9 - makes team better
  - Why underrated? His VALUE is defensive disruption, not box score stats
  - BPM can't capture "elite perimeter defender" without tracking data

Luka Garza (OVERRATED by 1.9-3.7 BPM):
  - Moderate TS%: 65%, 58%, 57% - doesn't trigger efficiency penalties
  - Terrible defense: 0.3-0.5 BLK/36 for a CENTER (should be 1.5+)
  - Position ~4.3 = PF/C - formula expects rim protection
  - Why overrated? Position inflation + no defensive penalty
  - His scoring output (27 PTS/36) looks great but ignores defensive hole

CONCLUSION: The "low minute" category was a red herring. The real issue:
  - DEFENSIVE SPECIALISTS (GP2-type) need defense tracking to value correctly
  - DEFENSIVE LIABILITIES (Garza-type) aren't penalized for low BLK/STL

UNCONFIRMED CATEGORY 2: OFF-BALL WING OVERRATE
----------------------------------------------
FINDING: NOT A CONSISTENT PATTERN - Kispert may be an outlier.

Moses Moody errors:
  2022-23: -2.1 (underrated, not overrated!)
  2023-24: +0.9 (slight overrate)
  2024-25: +1.3 (slight overrate)

The Kispert hypothesis doesn't generalize. Off-ball wings have mixed errors.

UNCONFIRMED CATEGORY 3: ELITE PLAYMAKER
---------------------------------------
FINDING: OPPOSITE PATTERNS for Curry vs Luka. Not a single "elite playmaker" issue.

Stephen Curry (UNDERRATED by 2.0 BPM in 2023-24, 2024-25):
  - TS%: 61.6%, 61.8% - above average but not elite (no high bonus)
  - AST/36: 5.6, 6.7 - LOWER than Luka's 7.8-9.4
  - NET_RTG: +2.5, +4.1 - positive team impact
  - Position: 2.05-2.17 - guard, no AST big bonus
  
  ROOT CAUSE: "GRAVITY" not captured. Curry's off-ball movement, screens,
  and threat of shooting opens up the entire offense. This creates value
  that doesn't show up in AST%. He doesn't need to PASS to create value.

Luka Dončić (OVERRATED by 1.9 BPM in 2022-23, now correct):
  - TS%: 60.9% to 58.7% - average to below-average
  - AST/36: 7.8-9.4 - ELITE playmaking volume
  - NET_RTG: -1.3 in 2022-23! - team was WORSE with him on court
  
  ROOT CAUSE (2022-23): Negative NET_RTG should penalize more. He gets
  +10.2 BPM but team was -1.3 with him on court. Either defensive metrics
  or turnover-heavy play style not penalized enough.
  
  CURRENT (2023-24, 2024-25): Errors now +0.2 and +0.5 = acceptable.
  His NET_RTG improved to +3.8 and +5.2.

INSIGHT: The Curry/Luka difference suggests:
  1. Need a "gravity" adjustment for elite shooters (Position < 3, FG3A high)
  2. Need to penalize negative NET_RTG more heavily
  3. The existing NET_RTG adjustment (0.11 * NET_RTG) may be too weak

-------------------------------------
- Full B-REF BPM 2.0 formula
- Custom adjustments: AST big bonus, NET_RTG, minutes regression
- Compression and offset calibration
- MAE achieved: 1.219
