Notes:
- Entries marked [NOT FOUND] did not appear in the sampled NBA API endpoints used in the run (TeamGameLog, PlayerGameLog, LeagueDashPlayerStats, PlayerProfileV2 attempt).
- Several mappings are very rough (e.g., single-letter columns like 'L' or generic columns like 'GP' or 'W') and should be validated by querying additional endpoints (PlayerProfileV2 with correct arguments, tracking endpoints like tracking player tracking stats, or the newer stats endpoints) or by checking NBA API docs.

Suggested next steps:
- Query PlayerProfileV2 correctly (adjust init args) and other advanced endpoints (playertracking, playerdashboard, on/off endpoints) to find missing metrics.
- For each [NOT FOUND] metric, search NBA stats API docs or online references to find canonical column names.
