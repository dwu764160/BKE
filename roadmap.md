# 🏀 Basketball Predictive Analytics Engine: Project Design & Roadmap

## 1. Project Vision & Goals
The goal is to engineer a sophisticated analytics tool that uses historical data and machine learning to predict the outcomes of NBA games and forecast individual player performances. This engine will serve as a powerful tool for statistical analysis, allowing us to identify trends, evaluate team strengths, and make data-driven predictions.

---

## 2. Core Features (Phased Approach)

### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Automated Data Aggregation
- Team & Player Dashboard
- Basic Game Predictor (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Basic Player Performance Forecaster

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics & Predictive Modeling
- Advanced Game Prediction Model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Advanced Player Performance Model
- Simulation Engine for probabilistic game outcomes

---

## 3. System Architecture

### Data Layer
- **Source**: `nba_api` for official stats.nba.com data
- **Storage**: Parquet files or SQLite for efficient querying

### Analytics Core (Engine)
- Data processing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction logic in Python

### Presentation Layer (UI)
- **Streamlit** app with dashboards, visualizations, and prediction forms

---

## 4. Technology Stack
| Component | Choice |
|------------|---------|
| Language | Python 3 |
| Data Analysis | Pandas, NumPy |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn, XGBoost |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly |
| Web App Framework | Streamlit |
| Data Source | nba_api |

---

## 5. Data Strategy
- **Historical Data**: Fetch 3–5 NBA seasons using `nba_api` or Basketball Reference
- **Live Updates**: Weekly automated fetches for new games
- **Weighting System**: Blend historical and recent data to reflect trends

---

## 6. Detailed Project Roadmap

### 🧩 Environment & Tooling Setup
- Set up project folder, Git repo, virtual environment
- Install dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `streamlit`, `nba_api`
- Configure `.gitignore` and test Streamlit

### 🏀 Data Acquisition & Storage
- Scripts to fetch historical and weekly data via `nba_api`
- Store data in Parquet or SQLite
- Clean, standardize, and merge datasets

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering
- Perform EDA in Jupyter Notebook
- Create rolling averages, team form metrics, and opponent strength
- Save engineered features

### 🤖 Model Development
#### Game Outcome Model
- Logistic Regression baseline → later upgrade to XGBoost
- Features: team-level averages, win %, pace, defensive rating

#### Player Performance Model
- Linear Regression baseline → later upgrade to Random Forest
- Predict PTS, REB, AST from recent trends, usage rate, opponent defense

### 📊 Evaluation & Interpretability
- Evaluate accuracy and performance (cross-validation)
- Use SHAP to interpret features
- Log metrics and model versions

### 💻 Web App Development (Streamlit)
- Pages:
  - Dashboard (team/player stats)
  - Game Predictor (matchup input → winner probability)
  - Player Forecaster (player input → next game stats)
- Include interactive charts with Plotly

### 🔄 Automation (Weekly Updates)
- Script for weekly `nba_api` updates
- Schedule with cron/Task Scheduler or GitHub Actions
- Automatically retrain and update models

### 🧪 Testing & Optimization
- Unit tests for data and model scripts
- Log performance metrics and retraining summaries
- Optimize feature generation and runtime

### 🚀 Deployment (Local → Public)
- Local testing with `streamlit run app.py`
- Public hosting options:
  - Streamlit Community Cloud (free)
  - Render or Fly.io (for scalability)
- Securely manage environment variables

|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Setup | Environment, repo, dependencies | 1–2 days |
| Data | Clean datasets and fetch scripts | 3–5 days |
| EDA/Features | Engineered features and insights | 4–7 days |
| Models | Baseline + advanced models | 5–10 days |
| Evaluation | Metrics and explainability tools | 2–3 days |
| Web App | Streamlit dashboard | 5–7 days |
| Automation | Weekly update pipeline | 2–3 days |
| Deployment | App online and secure | 1–3 days |

---

## 8. Next Steps
1. Set up environment and dependencies.  
2. Begin historical data ingestion.  
3. Run EDA and identify impactful variables.  
4. Build and evaluate baseline models.  
5. Develop Streamlit dashboard.  
6. Implement weekly automation and deploy.

---

## ✅ Summary
This plan fully defines the architecture, tools, and roadmap needed for your basketball predictive engine. The next stage is to **begin implementation**, starting with the environment setup and historical data acquisition.
